# Contributing

For any changes, please create a feature branch and open a PR for it when you
feel it's ready to merge. Even if there's no real disagreement about a PR, at
least one other person on the team needs to look over a PR before merging. The
purpose of this review requirement is to ensure shared knowledge of the app and
its changes and to take advantage of the benefits of working together changes
without any single person being a bottleneck to making progress.
