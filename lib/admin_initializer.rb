# Initializes an admin user from ENV
#
# The purpose of this class is to isolate the behavior required by the
# `rake users:initialize_admin` task for easier testing and code maintainability.
# For testing purposes, ENV and Rails.logger can be overridden by keyword
# arguments when the class is instantiated.
